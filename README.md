# Landing-Page

This project is to create a landing page modeled from an image provided by The Odin Project.

The website to be replicated is based on this img: https://cdn.statically.io/gh/TheOdinProject/curriculum/main/foundations/html_css/project/odin-project.png

As well these are the font styling and background choices used on the landing page: https://cdn.statically.io/gh/TheOdinProject/curriculum/main/foundations/html_css/project/colors_and_stuff.png
